# Betzy

Welcome to **Betzy**! This is a mobile app we built to bring classic casino games to your phone—with a fun crypto twist. It's a complete project that shows how you can blend traditional mobile app features with the world of Solana.

Think of it as both a fun game to play **and** a great starting point for anyone interested in building their own mobile crypto app.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

At its heart, **Betzy** is a collection of games with a built-in crypto wallet. Here’s what you’ll find:

- 🎲 **A Full Suite of Games**  
  Play Texas Hold'em Poker against a computer that thinks like a real player, classic Blackjack, and a strategy game called Mines.

- 🔐 **Your Own Solana Wallet**  
  When you sign up, the app creates a secure wallet for you on the Solana network. You can use it to send and receive SOL.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Ready for Multiplayer**  
  We’ve built a secure system on Solana to handle game buy-ins and payouts. This is the foundation for future multiplayer games where you can compete using real crypto.
