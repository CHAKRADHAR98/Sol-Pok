Betzy
Welcome to Betzy! This is a mobile app we built to bring classic casino games to your phone, with a fun crypto twist. It's a complete project that shows how you can mix regular mobile app features with the world of Solana.

Think of it as both a fun game to play and a great starting point for anyone who wants to build their own mobile crypto app.

What's Inside?
At its heart, Betzy is a collection of games with a built-in crypto wallet. Here’s what you'll find:

A Full Suite of Games: You can play Texas Hold'em Poker against a computer that thinks like a real player, classic Blackjack, and a strategy game called Mines.

Your Own Solana Wallet: When you sign up, the app gives you your own secure wallet on the Solana network. You can use it to send and receive SOL.

Ready for Multiplayer: We've also built a secure system on Solana to handle game buy-ins and payouts. This is the foundation for future multiplayer games where you can play against others using real crypto.

What It's Built With
We used a handful of modern tools to create Betzy:

React Native & Expo for the mobile app itself.

Privy to handle user sign-ups and create the wallets.

Solana for all the crypto-related features.

Rust & Anchor for the on-chain multiplayer program.

Google Gemini to power the smart poker AI.
